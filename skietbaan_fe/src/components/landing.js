        Daddy
  by Sylvia Plath
  
  You do not do, you do not do
  Any more, black shoe
  In which I have lived like a foot
  For thirty years, poor and white,
  Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.
  
  Daddy, I have had to kill you.
  You died before I had time—
  Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,
  Ghastly statue with one gray toe
  Big as a Frisco seal
  
  And a head in the freakish Atlantic
  Where it pours bean green over blue
  In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.
  I used to pray to recover you.
  Ach, du.
  
  In the German tongue, in the Polish town
  Scraped flat by the roller
  Of wars, wars, wars.
  But the name of the town is common.
  My Polack friend
  
  Says there are a dozen or two.
  So I never could tell where you
  Put your foot, your root, 
  I never could talk to you.
  The tongue stuck in my jaw.
  
  It stuck in a barb wire snare.
  Ich, ich, ich, ich,
  I could hardly speak.
  I thought every German was you.
  And the language obscene
  
  An engine, an engine, 
  Chuffing me off like a Jew.
  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.
  I began to talk like a Jew.
  I think I may well be a Jew.
  
  The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna 
  Are not very pure or true.
  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck
  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack
  I may be a bit of a Jew.
  
  I have always been scared of you,
  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.
  And your neat mustache
  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.
  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You—
  
  Not God but a swastika
  So black no sky could squeak through.
  Every woman adores a Fascist,
  The boot in the face, the brute
  Brute heart of a brute like you.
  
  You stand at the blackboard, daddy,
  In the picture I have of you,
  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot
  But no less a devil for that, no not
  Any less the black man who
  
  Bit my pretty red heart in two.
  I was ten when they buried you.
  At twenty I tried to die
  And get back, back, back to you.
  I thought even the bones would do.
  
  But they pulled me out of the sack,
  And they stuck me together with glue.
  And then I knew what to do.
  I made a model of you,
  A man in black with a Meinkampf look
  
  And a love of the rack and the screw.
  And I said I do, I do.
  So daddy, I'm finally through.
  The black telephone's off at the root,
  The voices just can't worm through.
  
  If I've killed one man, I've killed two—
  The vampire who said he was you
  And drank my blood for a year,
  Seven years, if you want to know.
  Daddy, you can lie back now.
  
  There's a stake in your fat black heart
  And the villagers never liked you.
  They are dancing and stamping on you.
  They always knew it was you.
  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.
  
  
  
  In Memory of W. B. Yeats
  by W. H. Auden
  
  I
  
  He disappeared in the dead of winter:
  The brooks were frozen, the airports almost deserted,
  And snow disfigured the public statues;
  The mercury sank in the mouth of the dying day.
  What instruments we have agree
  The day of his death was a dark cold day.
  
  Far from his illness
  The wolves ran on through the evergreen forests,
  The peasant river was untempted by the fashionable quays;
  By mourning tongues
  The death of the poet was kept from his poems.
  
  But for him it was his last afternoon as himself,
  An afternoon of nurses and rumours;
  The provinces of his body revolted,
  The squares of his mind were empty,
  Silence invaded the suburbs,
  The current of his feeling failed; he became his admirers.
  
  Now he is scattered among a hundred cities
  And wholly given over to unfamiliar affections,
  To find his happiness in another kind of wood
  And be punished under a foreign code of conscience.
  The words of a dead man
  Are modified in the guts of the living.
  
  But in the importance and noise of to-morrow
  When the brokers are roaring like beasts on the floor of the Bourse,
  And the poor have the sufferings to which they are fairly accustomed,
  And each in the cell of himself is almost convinced of his freedom,
  A few thousand will think of this day
  As one thinks of a day when one did something slightly unusual.
  
  What instruments we have agree
  The day of his death was a dark cold day.
  
  II
  
  You were silly like us; your gift survived it all:
  The parish of rich women, physical decay,
  Yourself. Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.
  Now Ireland has her madness and her weather still,
  For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives
  In the valley of its making where executives
  Would never want to tamper, flows on south
  From ranches of isolation and the busy griefs,
  Raw towns that we believe and die in; it survives,
  A way of happening, a mouth.
  
  III
  
  Earth, receive an honoured guest:
  William Yeats is laid to rest.
  Let the Irish vessel lie
  Emptied of its poetry.
  
  In the nightmare of the dark
  All the dogs of Europe bark,
  And the living nations wait,
  Each sequestered in its hate;
  
  Intellectual disgrace
  Stares from every human face,
  And the seas of pity lie
  Locked and frozen in each eye.
  
  Follow, poet, follow right
  To the bottom of the night,
  With your unconstraining voice
  Still persuade us to rejoice;
  
  With the farming of a verse
  Make a vineyard of the curse,
  Sing of human unsuccess
  In a rapture of distress;
  
  In the deserts of the heart
  Let the healing fountain start,
  In the prison of his days
  Teach the free man how to praise.
  
  
  
  Proem: To Brooklyn Bridge 
  by Hart Crane
  
  How many dawns, chill from his rippling rest
  The seagull's wings shall dip and pivot him,
  Shedding white rings of tumult, building high
  Over the chained bay waters Liberty—
  
  Then, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes
  As apparitional as sails that cross
  Some page of figures to be filed away;
  —Till elevators drop us from our day ...
  
  I think of cinemas, panoramic sleights
  With multitudes bent toward some flashing scene
  Never disclosed, but hastened to again,
  Foretold to other eyes on the same screen;
  
  And Thee, across the harbor, silver-paced
  As though the sun took step of thee, yet left
  Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,—
  Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!
  
  Out of some subway scuttle, cell or loft
  A bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,
  Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,
  A jest falls from the speechless caravan.
  
  Down Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,
  A rip-tooth of the sky's acetylene;
  All afternoon the cloud-flown derricks turn ...
  Thy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.
  
  And obscure as that heaven of the Jews,
  Thy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow
  Of anonymity time cannot raise:
  Vibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.
  
  O harp and altar, of the fury fused,
  (How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!)
  Terrific threshold of the prophet's pledge,
  Prayer of pariah, and the lover's cry,—
  
  Again the traffic lights that skim thy swift
  Unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,
  Beading thy path—condense eternity:
  And we have seen night lifted in thine arms.
  
  Under thy shadow by the piers I waited;
  Only in darkness is thy shadow clear.
  The City's fiery parcels all undone,
  Already snow submerges an iron year ...
  
  O Sleepless as the river under thee,
  Vaulting the sea, the prairies' dreaming sod,
  Unto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend
  And of the curveship lend a myth to God. 
  
  
  
  Tom O' Bedlam's Song 
  anonymous ballad, circa 1620
  
  From the hag and hungry goblin
  That into rags would rend ye,
  The spirit that stands by the naked man
  In the Book of Moons, defend ye.
  That of your five sound senses
  You never be forsaken,
  Nor wander from your selves with Tom
  Abroad to beg your bacon,
      While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
      Feeding, drink or clothing;
      Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
      Poor Tom will injure nothing.
  
  Of thirty bare years have I
  Twice twenty been enragèd,
  And of forty been three times fifteen
  In durance soundly cagèd.
  On the lordly lofts of Bedlam
  With stubble soft and dainty,
  Brave bracelets strong, sweet whips, ding-dong,
  With wholesome hunger plenty,
      And now I sing, Any food, any feeding,
      Feeding, drink or clothing;
      Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
      Poor Tom will injure nothing.
  
  With a thought I took for Maudlin,
  And a cruse of cockle pottage,
  With a thing thus tall, sky bless you all,
  I befell into this dotage.
  I slept not since the Conquest,
  Till then I never wakèd,
  Till the roguish boy of love where I lay
  Me found and stript me nakèd.
      While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
      Feeding, drink or clothing;
      Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
      Poor Tom will injure nothing.
  
  When I short have shorn my sow's face
  And swigged my horny barrel,
  In an oaken inn, I pound my skin
  As a suit of gilt apparel;
  The moon's my constant mistress,
  And the lovely owl my marrow;
  The flaming drake and the night crow make
  Me music to my sorrow.
      While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
      Feeding, drink or clothing;
      Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
      Poor Tom will injure nothing.
  
  The palsy plagues my pulses
  When I prig your pigs or pullen
  Your culvers take, or matchless make
  Your Chanticleer or Sullen.
  When I want provant, with Humphry
  I sup, and when benighted,
  I repose in Paul's with waking souls,
  Yet never am affrighted.
      But I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
      Feeding, drink or clothing;
      Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
      Poor Tom will injure nothing.
  
  I know more than Apollo,
  For oft when he lies sleeping
  I see the stars at mortal wars
  In the wounded welkin weeping.
  The moon embrace her shepherd,
  And the Queen of Love her warrior,
  While the first doth horn the star of morn,
  And the next the heavenly Farrier.
      While I do sing, Any food, any feeding,
      Feeding, drink or clothing;
      Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
      Poor Tom will injure nothing.
  
  The Gypsies, Snap and Pedro,
  Are none of Tom's comradoes,
  The punk I scorn, and the cutpurse sworn
  And the roaring boy's bravadoes.
  The meek, the white, the gentle,
  Me handle not nor spare not;
  But those that cross Tom Rynosseross
  Do what the panther dare not.
      Although I sing, Any food, any feeding,
      Feeding, drink or clothing;
      Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
      Poor Tom will injure nothing.
  
  With an host of furious fancies,
  Whereof I am commander,
  With a burning spear and a horse of air
  To the wilderness I wander.
  By a knight of ghosts and shadows
  I summoned am to tourney
  Ten leagues beyond the wide world's end:
  Methinks it is no journey.
      Yet I will sing, Any food, any feeding,
      Feeding, drink or clothing;
      Come dame or maid, be not afraid,
      Poor Tom will injure nothing.
  
  
  
  After the Persian
  by Louise Bogan
  
  I
  
  I do not wish to know
  The depths of your terrible jungle:
  From what nest your leopard leaps
  Or what sterile lianas are at once your serpents' disguise
        and home.
  
  I am the dweller on the temperate threshold,
  The strip of corn and vine,
  Where all is translucence (the light!)
  Liquidity, and the sound of water.
  Here the days pass under shade
  And the nights have the waxing and the waning moon.
  Here the moths take flight at evening;
  Here at morning the dove whistles and the pigeons coo.
  Here, as night comes on, the fireflies wink and snap
  Close to the cool ground,
  Shining in a profusion
  Celestial or marine.
  
  Here it is never wholly dark but always wholly green,
  And the day stains with what seems to be more than the
        sun
  What may be more than my flesh.
  
  II
  
  I have wept with the spring storm;
  Burned with the brutal summer.
  Now, hearing the wind and the twanging bow-strings,
  I know what winter brings.
  
  The hunt sweeps out upon the plain
  And the garden darkens.
  They will bring the trophies home
  To bleed and perish
  Beside the trellis and the lattices,
  Beside the fountain, still flinging diamond water,
  Beside the pool
  (Which is eight-sided, like my heart).
  
  III
  
  All has been translated into treasure: 
  Weightless as amber,
  Translucent as the currant on the branch,
  Dark as the rose's thorn.
  
  Where is the shimmer of evil?
  This is the shell's iridescence
  And the wild bird's wing.
  
  IV
  
  Ignorant, I took up my burden in the wilderness.
  Wise with great wisdom, I shall lay it down upon flowers.
  
  V
  
  Goodbye, goodbye!
  There was so much to love, I could not love it all;
  I could not love it enough.
  
  Some things I overlooked, and some I could not find.
  Let the crystal clasp them
  When you drink your wine, in autumn.
  
  
  
  Elegy Written in a Country Church-Yard
  by Thomas Gray
  
  The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
  The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea,
  The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
  And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
  
  Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
  And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
  Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:
  
  Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower
  The moping owl does to the moon complain
  Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
  Molest her ancient solitary reign.
  
  Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
  Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
  Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
  The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.
  
  The breezy call of incense-breathing morn,
  The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
  The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
  
  For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
  Or busy housewife ply her evening care:
  No children run to lisp their sire's return,
  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share,
  
  Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,
  Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
  How jocund did they drive their team afield!
  How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!
  
  Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
  Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
  Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile
  The short and simple annals of the Poor.
  
  The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,
  And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,
  Awaits alike th' inevitable hour:—
  The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
  
  Nor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault
  If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise,
  Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault
  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.
  
  Can storied urn or animated bust
  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?
  Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust,
  Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?
  
  Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid
  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;
  Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
  Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:
  
  But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
  Rich with the spoils of time, did ne'er unroll;
  Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
  And froze the genial current of the soul.
  
  Full many a gem of purest ray serene
  The dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear:
  Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
  And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
  
  Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast
  The little tyrant of his fields withstood,
  Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,
  Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.
  
  Th' applause of list'ning senates to command,
  The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
  To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land,
  And read their history in a nation's eyes,
  
  Their lot forbad: nor circumscribed alone
  Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;
  Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,
  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,
  
  The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,
  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,
  Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
  With incense kindled at the Muse's flame.
  
  Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
  Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
  Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
  They kept the noiseless tenour of their way.
  
  Yet e'en these bones from insult to protect
  Some frail memorial still erected nigh,
  With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd,
  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.
  
  Their name, their years, spelt by th' unletter'd Muse,
  The place of fame and elegy supply:
  And many a holy text around she strews,
  That teach the rustic moralist to die.
  
  For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,
  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd,
  Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
  Nor cast one longing lingering look behind?
  
  On some fond breast the parting soul relies,
  Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
  E'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,
  E'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.
  
  For thee, who, mindful of th' unhonour'd dead,
  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate;
  If chance, by lonely contemplation led,
  Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,—
  
  Haply some hoary-headed swain may say,
  Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn
  Brushing with hasty steps the dews away,
  To meet the sun upon the upland lawn;
  
  'There at the foot of yonder nodding beech
  That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high.
  His listless length at noontide would he stretch,
  And pore upon the brook that babbles by.
  
  'Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,
  Muttering his wayward fancies he would rove;
  Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,
  Or crazed with care, or cross'd in hopeless love.
  
  'One morn I miss'd him on the custom'd hill,
  Along the heath, and near his favourite tree;
  Another came; nor yet beside the rill,
  Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he;
  
  'The next with dirges due in sad array
  Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne,—
  Approach and read (for thou canst read) the lay
  Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn.'
  
  The Epitaph
  
  Here rests his head upon the lap of Earth
  A youth to Fortune and to Fame unknown.
  Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth,
  And Melancholy marked him for her own.
  
  Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
  Heaven did a recompense as largely send:
  He gave to Misery all he had, a tear,
  He gained from Heaven ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.
  
  No farther seek his merits to disclose,
  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode
  (There they alike in trembling hope repose),
  The bosom of his Father and his God.
  
  
  
  Dylan Marlais Thomas (1914-1953) despite being born in South Wales was "the archetypal Romantic poet of the popular American imagination—he was flamboyantly theatrical, a heavy drinker, engaged in roaring disputes in public, and read his work aloud with tremendous depth of feeling and a singing Welsh lilt."
  
  Fern Hill
  by Dylan Thomas
  
  Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs
  About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,
       The night above the dingle starry,
            Time let me hail and climb
       Golden in the heydays of his eyes,
  And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns
  And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves
            Trail with daisies and barley
       Down the rivers of the windfall light.
  
  And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns
  About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,
       In the sun that is young once only,
            Time let me play and be 
       Golden in the mercy of his means,
  And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves
  Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and cold,
            And the sabbath rang slowly
       In the pebbles of the holy streams.
  
  All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay
  Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was air
       And playing, lovely and watery
            And fire green as grass.
       And nightly under the simple stars
  As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,
  All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the nightjars
       Flying with the ricks, and the horses
            Flashing into the dark.
  
  And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white
  With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all
       Shining, it was Adam and maiden,
            The sky gathered again
       And the sun grew round that very day.
  So it must have been after the birth of the simple light
  In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking warm
       Out of the whinnying green stable
            On to the fields of praise.
  
  And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house
  Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,
       In the sun born over and over,
            I ran my heedless ways,
       My wishes raced through the house high hay
  And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows
  In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs
       Before the children green and golden
            Follow him out of grace,
  
  Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would take me
  Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,
       In the moon that is always rising,
            Nor that riding to sleep
       I should hear him fly with the high fields
  And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.
  Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,
            Time held me green and dying
       Though I sang in my chains like the sea.
  
  
  
  Church Going
  by Philip Larkin
  
  Once I am sure there's nothing going on
  I step inside, letting the door thud shut.
  Another church: matting, seats, and stone,
  And little books; sprawlings of flowers, cut
  For Sunday, brownish now; some brass and stuff
  Up at the holy end; the small neat organ;
  And a tense, musty, unignorable silence,
  Brewed God knows how long. Hatless, I take off
  My cycle-clips in awkward reverence,
  
  Move forward, run my hand around the font.
  From where I stand, the roof looks almost new—
  Cleaned or restored? Someone would know: I don't.
  Mounting the lectern, I peruse a few
  Hectoring large-scale verses, and pronounce
  "Here endeth" much more loudly than I'd meant.
  The echoes snigger briefly. Back at the door
  I sign the book, donate an Irish sixpence,
  Reflect the place was not worth stopping for.
  
  Yet stop I did: in fact I often do,
  And always end much at a loss like this,
  Wondering what to look for; wondering, too,
  When churches fall completely out of use
  What we shall turn them into, if we shall keep
  A few cathedrals chronically on show,
  Their parchment, plate, and pyx in locked cases,
  And let the rest rent-free to rain and sheep.
  Shall we avoid them as unlucky places?
  
  Or, after dark, will dubious women come
  To make their children touch a particular stone;
  Pick simples for a cancer; or on some
  Advised night see walking a dead one?
  Power of some sort or other will go on
  In games, in riddles, seemingly at random;
  But superstition, like belief, must die,
  And what remains when disbelief has gone?
  Grass, weedy pavement, brambles, buttress, sky,
  
  A shape less recognizable each week,
  A purpose more obscure. I wonder who
  Will be the last, the very last, to seek
  This place for what it was; one of the crew
  That tap and jot and know what rood-lofts were?
  Some ruin-bibber, randy for antique,
  Or Christmas-addict, counting on a whiff
  Of gown-and-bands and organ-pipes and myrrh?
  Or will he be my representative,
  
  Bored, uninformed, knowing the ghostly silt
  Dispersed, yet tending to this cross of ground
  Through suburb scrub because it held unspilt
  So long and equably what since is found
  Only in separation—marriage, and birth,
  And death, and thoughts of these—for whom was built
  This special shell? For, though I've no idea
  What this accoutred frowsty barn is worth,
  It pleases me to stand in silence here;
  
  A serious house on serious earth it is,
  In whose blent air all our compulsions meet,
  Are recognised, and robed as destinies.
  And that much never can be obsolete,
  Since someone will forever be surprising
  A hunger in himself to be more serious,
  And gravitating with it to this ground,
  Which, he once heard, was proper to grow wise in,
  If only that so many dead lie round.
  
  
  
  Ode : Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood
  by William Wordsworth
  
  There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
  The earth, and every common sight,
                To me did seem
             Apparell'd in celestial light,
  The glory and the freshness of a dream.
  It is not now as it hath been of yore;—
             Turn wheresoe'er I may,
                 By night or day,
  The things which I have seen I now can see no more.
  
      The rainbow comes and goes,
      And lovely is the rose;
      The moon doth with delight
  Look round her when the heavens are bare;
      Waters on a starry night
      Are beautiful and fair;
    The sunshine is a glorious birth;
    But yet I know, where'er I go,
  That there hath pass'd away a glory from the earth.
  
  Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,
    And while the young lambs bound
      As to the tabor's sound,
  To me alone there came a thought of grief:
  A timely utterance gave that thought relief,
      And I again am strong:
  The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;
  No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;
  I hear the echoes through the mountains throng,
  The winds come to me from the fields of sleep,
            And all the earth is gay;
                    Land and sea
            Give themselves up to jollity,
               And with the heart of May
            Doth every beast keep holiday;—
                   Thou Child of Joy,
  Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy!
  
  Ye blessèd creatures, I have heard the call
     Ye to each other make; I see
  The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;
     My heart is at your festival,
         My head hath its coronal,
  The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all.
         O evil day! if I were sullen
         While Earth herself is adorning,
             This sweet May-morning,
            And the children are culling
                   On every side,
    In a thousand valleys far and wide,
    Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,
  And the babe leaps up on his mother's arm:—
           I hear, I hear, with joy I hear!
           —But there's a tree, of many, one,
  A single field which I have look'd upon,
  Both of them speak of something that is gone:
              The pansy at my feet
              Doth the same tale repeat:
  Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
  Where is it now, the glory and the dream?
  
  Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
  The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
          Hath had elsewhere its setting,
              And cometh from afar:
          Not in entire forgetfulness,
          And not in utter nakedness,
  But trailing clouds of glory do we come
          From God, who is our home:
  Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
  Shades of the prison-house begin to close
          Upon the growing Boy,
                      But he 
  Beholds the light, and whence it flows,
             He sees it in his joy;
  The Youth, who daily farther from the east
         Must travel, still is Nature's priest,
         And by the vision splendid
         Is on his way attended;
  At length the Man perceives it die away,
  And fade into the light of common day.
  
  Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;
  Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,
  And, even with something of a mother's mind,
         And no unworthy aim,
         The homely nurse doth all she can
  To make her foster-child, her Inmate Man,
         Forget the glories he hath known,
  And that imperial palace whence he came.
  
  Behold the Child among his new-born blisses,
  A six years' darling of a pigmy size!
  See, where 'mid work of his own hand he lies,
  Fretted by sallies of his mother's kisses,
  With light upon him from his father's eyes!
  See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,
  Some fragment from his dream of human life,
  Shaped by himself with newly-learnèd art;
           A wedding or a festival,
           A mourning or a funeral;
              And this hath now his heart,
          And unto this he frames his song:
              Then will he fit his tongue
  To dialogues of business, love, or strife;
              But it will not be long
           Ere this be thrown aside,
           And with new joy and pride
  The little actor cons another part;
  Filling from time to time his 'humorous stage'
  With all the Persons, down to palsied Age,
  That Life brings with her in her equipage;
           As if his whole vocation
           Were endless imitation.
  
  Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie
                Thy soul's immensity;
  Thou best philosopher, who yet dost keep
  Thy heritage, thou eye among the blind,
  That, deaf and silent, read'st the eternal deep,
  Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,—
         Mighty prophet! Seer blest!
         On whom those truths do rest,
  Which we are toiling all our lives to find,
  In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;
  Thou, over whom thy Immortality
  Broods like the Day, a master o'er a slave,
  A presence which is not to be put by;
        To whom the grave
  Is but a lonely bed without the sense or sight
        Of day or the warm light,
  A place of thought where we in waiting lie;
  Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might
  Of heaven-born freedom on thy being's height,
  Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke
  The years to bring the inevitable yoke,
  Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?
  Full soon thy soul shall have her earthly freight,
  And custom lie upon thee with a weight,
  Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!
  
        O joy! that in our embers
        Is something that doth live,
        That nature yet remembers
        What was so fugitive!
  The thought of our past years in me doth breed
  Perpetual benediction: not indeed
  For that which is most worthy to be blest—
  Delight and liberty, the simple creed
  Of childhood, whether busy or at rest,
  With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:—
        Not for these I raise
        The song of thanks and praise;
        But for those obstinate questionings
        Of sense and outward things,
        Fallings from us, vanishings;
        Blank misgivings of a Creature
  Moving about in worlds not realized,
  High instincts before which our mortal Nature
  Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:
        But for those first affections,
        Those shadowy recollections,
        Which, be they what they may,
  Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,
  Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;
        Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make
  Our noisy years seem moments in the being
  Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake,
                To perish never:
  Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,
                Nor Man nor Boy,
  Nor all that is at enmity with joy,
  Can utterly abolish or destroy!
        Hence in a season of calm weather
        Though inland far we be,
  Our souls have sight of that immortal sea
        Which brought us hither,
        Can in a moment travel thither,
  And see the children sport upon the shore,
  And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.
  
  Then sing, ye birds, sing, sing a joyous song!
        And let the young lambs bound
        As to the tabor's sound!
  We in thought will join your throng,
        Ye that pipe and ye that play,
        Ye that through your hearts to-day
        Feel the gladness of the May!
  What though the radiance which was once so bright
  Be now for ever taken from my sight,
        Though nothing can bring back the hour
  Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;
        We will grieve not, rather find
        Strength in what remains behind;
        In the primal sympathy
        Which having been must ever be;
        In the soothing thoughts that spring
        Out of human suffering;
        In the faith that looks through death,
  In years that bring the philosophic mind.
  
  And O ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves,
  Forebode not any severing of our loves!
  Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might;
  I only have relinquish'd one delight
  To live beneath your more habitual sway.
  I love the brooks which down their channels fret,
  Even more than when I tripp'd lightly as they;
  The innocent brightness of a new-born Day
                Is lovely yet;
  The clouds that gather round the setting sun
  Do take a sober colouring from an eye
  That hath kept watch o'er man's mortality;
  Another race hath been, and other palms are won.
  Thanks to the human heart by which we live,
  Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,
  To me the meanest flower that blows can give
  Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.
  The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, 
The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, 
The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, 
And the highwayman came riding—
                      Riding—riding—
The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn-door. 

He'd a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin, 
A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin; 
They fitted with never a wrinkle: his boots were up to the thigh! 
And he rode with a jewelled twinkle, 
                      His pistol butts a-twinkle, 
His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky. 

Over the cobbles he clattered and clashed in the dark inn-yard, 
And he tapped with his whip on the shutters, but all was locked and barred; 
He whistled a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there 
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter, 
                      Bess, the landlord's daughter, 
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair. 

And dark in the dark old inn-yard a stable-wicket creaked 
Where Tim the ostler listened; his face was white and peaked; 
His eyes were hollows of madness, his hair like mouldy hay, 
But he loved the landlord's daughter, 
                      The landlord's red-lipped daughter, 
Dumb as a dog he listened, and he heard the robber say—

"One kiss, my bonny sweetheart, I'm after a prize to-night, 
But I shall be back with the yellow gold before the morning light; 
Yet, if they press me sharply, and harry me through the day, 
Then look for me by moonlight, 
                      Watch for me by moonlight, 
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way." 

He rose upright in the stirrups; he scarce could reach her hand, 
But she loosened her hair i' the casement! His face burnt like a brand 
As the black cascade of perfume came tumbling over his breast; 
And he kissed its waves in the moonlight, 
                      (Oh, sweet, black waves in the moonlight!) 
Then he tugged at his rein in the moonlight, and galloped away to the West. 

He did not come in the dawning; he did not come at noon; 
And out o' the tawny sunset, before the rise o' the moon, 
When the road was a gypsy's ribbon, looping the purple moor, 
A red-coat troop came marching—
                      Marching—marching—
King George's men came matching, up to the old inn-door. 

They said no word to the landlord, they drank his ale instead, 
But they gagged his daughter and bound her to the foot of her narrow bed; 
Two of them knelt at her casement, with muskets at their side! 
There was death at every window; 
                      And hell at one dark window; 
For Bess could see, through her casement, the road that he would ride. 

They had tied her up to attention, with many a sniggering jest; 
They had bound a musket beside her, with the barrel beneath her breast! 
"Now, keep good watch!" and they kissed her. 
                      She heard the dead man say—
Look for me by moonlight; 
                      Watch for me by moonlight; 
I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way! 

She twisted her hands behind her; but all the knots held good! 
She writhed her hands till her fingers were wet with sweat or blood! 
They stretched and strained in the darkness, and the hours crawled by like years, 
Till, now, on the stroke of midnight, 
                      Cold, on the stroke of midnight, 
The tip of one finger touched it! The trigger at least was hers! 

The tip of one finger touched it; she strove no more for the rest! 
Up, she stood up to attention, with the barrel beneath her breast, 
She would not risk their hearing; she would not strive again; 
For the road lay bare in the moonlight; 
                      Blank and bare in the moonlight; 
And the blood of her veins in the moonlight throbbed to her love's refrain . 

Tlot-tlot; tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse-hoofs ringing clear; 
Tlot-tlot, tlot-tlot, in the distance? Were they deaf that they did not hear? 
Down the ribbon of moonlight, over the brow of the hill, 
The highwayman came riding, 
                      Riding, riding! 
The red-coats looked to their priming! She stood up, straight and still! 

Tlot-tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot, in the echoing night! 
Nearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light! 
Her eyes grew wide for a moment; she drew one last deep breath, 
Then her finger moved in the moonlight, 
                      Her musket shattered the moonlight, 
Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him—with her death. 

He turned; he spurred to the West; he did not know who stood 
Bowed, with her head o'er the musket, drenched with her own red blood! 
Not till the dawn he heard it, his face grew grey to hear 
How Bess, the landlord's daughter, 
                      The landlord's black-eyed daughter, 
Had watched for her love in the moonlight, and died in the darkness there. 

Back, he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky, 
With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high! 
Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat, 
When they shot him down on the highway, 
                      Down like a dog on the highway, 
And he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat. 

And still of a winter's night, they say, when the wind is in the trees, 
When the moon is a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, 
When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, 
A highwayman comes riding—
                      Riding—riding—
A highwayman comes riding, up to the old inn-door.

Over the cobbles he clatters and clangs in the dark inn-yard; 
He taps with his whip on the shutters, but all is locked and barred; 
He whistles a tune to the window, and who should be waiting there 
But the landlord's black-eyed daughter, 
                      Bess, the landlord's daughter, 
Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair.



His Confession
by the Archpoet
circa 1165; translated from the original Medieval Latin by Helen Waddell

Seething over inwardly
With fierce indignation,
In my bitterness of soul,
Hear my declaration.
I am of one element,
Levity my matter,
Like enough a withered leaf
For the winds to scatter.

Since it is the property 
Of the sapient 
To sit firm upon a rock, 
it is evident 
That I am a fool, since I 
Am a flowing river, 
Never under the same sky, 
Transient for ever.

Hither, thither, masterless
Ship upon the sea,
Wandering through the ways of air,
Go the birds like me.
Bound am I by ne'er a bond,
Prisoner to no key,
Questing go I for my kind,
Find depravity. 

Never yet could I endure
Soberness and sadness,
Jests I love and sweeter than
Honey find I gladness. 
Whatsoever Venus bids
Is a joy excelling,
Never in an evil heart
Did she make her dwelling.

Down the broad way do I go, 
Young and unregretting, 
Wrap me in my vices up, 
Virtue all forgetting, 
Greedier for all delight 
Than heaven to enter in: 
Since the soul is in me dead, 
Better save the skin.

Pardon, pray you, good my lord,
Master of discretion,
But this death I die is sweet,
Most delicious poison. 
Wounded to the quick am I
By a young girl's beauty: 
She's beyond my touching? Well,
Can't the mind do duty?

Hard beyond all hardness, this
Mastering of Nature:
Who shall say his heart is clean,
Near so fair a creature?
Young are we, so hard a law,
How should we obey it?
And our bodies, they are young,
Shall they have no say in't?

Sit you down amid the fire,
Will the fire not burn you?
To Pavia come, will you
Just as chaste return you?
Pavia, where Beauty draws
Youth with finger-tips,
Youth entangled in her eyes,
Ravished with her lips.

Let you bring Hippolytus,
In Pavia dine him,
Never more Hippolytus
Will the morning find him.
In Pavia not a road
But leads to venery
Nor among its crowding towers
One to chastity.

Yet a second charge they bring:
I'm forever gaming.
Yea, the dice hath many a time
Stripped me to my shaming.
What an' if the body's cold,
If the mind is burning,
On the anvil hammering,
Rhymes and verses turning?

Look again upon your list. 
Is the tavern on it? 
Yea, and never have I scorned,
Never shall I scorn it,
Till the holy angels come,
And my eyes discern them, 
Singing for the dying soul, 
Requiem aeternam.

For on this my heart is set: 
When the hour is nigh me, 
Let me in the tavern die, 
With a tankard by me, 
While the angels looking down 
Joyously sing o'er me, 
Deus sit propitius 
Huic potatori.

'Tis the fire that's in the cup
Kindles the soul's torches,
‘Tis the heart that drenched in wine
Flies to heaven's porches.
Sweeter tastes the wine to me
In a tavern tankard
That the watered stuff my Lord
Bishop has decanted.

Let them fast and water drink,
All the poets' chorus,
Fly the market and the crowd
Racketing uproarious.
Sit in quiet spots and think,
Shun the tavern's portal
Write, and never having lived,
Die to be immortal.

Never hath the spirit of
Poetry descended,
Till with food and drink my lean
Belly was distended,
But when Bacchus lords it in
My cerebral story,
Comes Apollo with a rush,
Fills me with his glory.

Unto every man his gift.
Mine was not for fasting.
Never could I find a rhyme
With my stomach wasting.
As the wine is, so the verse:
'Tis a better chorus
When the landlord hath a good 
Vintage set before us.

Good my lord, the case is heard,
I myself betray me,
And affirm myself to be
All my fellows say me.
See, they in thy presence are:
Let whoe'er hath known
His own heart and found it clean,
Cast at me the stone.



Let America Be America Again
by Langston Hughes 

Let America be America again.
Let it be the dream it used to be.
Let it be the pioneer on the plain
Seeking a home where he himself is free.

(America never was America to me.)

Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed—
Let it be that great strong land of love
Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme
That any man be crushed by one above.

(It never was America to me.)

O, let my land be a land where Liberty
Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,
But opportunity is real, and life is free,
Equality is in the air we breathe.

(There's never been equality for me,
Nor freedom in this "homeland of the free.")

Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark?
And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?

I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,
I am the Negro bearing slavery's scars.
I am the red man driven from the land,
I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek—
And finding only the same old stupid plan
Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.

I am the young man, full of strength and hope,
Tangled in that ancient endless chain
Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!
Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!
Of work the men! Of take the pay!
Of owning everything for one's own greed!

I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.
I am the worker sold to the machine.
I am the Negro, servant to you all.
I am the people, humble, hungry, mean—
Hungry yet today despite the dream.
Beaten yet today—O, Pioneers!
I am the man who never got ahead,
The poorest worker bartered through the years.

Yet I'm the one who dreamt our basic dream
In the Old World while still a serf of kings,
Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,
That even yet its mighty daring sings
In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned
That's made America the land it has become.
O, I'm the man who sailed those early seas
In search of what I meant to be my home—
For I'm the one who left dark Ireland's shore,
And Poland's plain, and England's grassy lea,
And torn from Black Africa's strand I came
To build a "homeland of the free."

The free?

Who said the free? Not me?
Surely not me? The millions on relief today?
The millions shot down when we strike?
The millions who have nothing for our pay?
For all the dreams we've dreamed
And all the songs we've sung
And all the hopes we've held
And all the flags we've hung,
The millions who have nothing for our pay—
Except the dream that's almost dead today.

O, let America be America again—
The land that never has been yet—
And yet must be—the land where every man is free.
The land that's mine—the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's, ME—
Who made America,
Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,
Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,
Must bring back our mighty dream again.

Sure, call me any ugly name you choose—
The steel of freedom does not stain.
From those who live like leeches on the people's lives,
We must take back our land again,
America!

O, yes,
I say it plain,
America never was America to me,
And yet I swear this oath—
America will be!

Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,
The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,
We, the people, must redeem
The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.
The mountains and the endless plain—
All, all the stretch of these great green states—
And make America again



The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock 
by T. S. Eliot

S'io credesse che mia risposta fosse
A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,
Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.
Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo
Non torno vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero,
Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo.[1]

Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherised upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question .
Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, "Do I dare?" and, "Do I dare?"
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair—
[They will say: "How his hair is growing thin!"]
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin—
[They will say: "But how his arms and legs are thin!"]
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

For I have known them all already, known them all:—
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
     So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all—
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
     And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all—
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
[But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]
It is perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
     And should I then presume?
     And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?. . .

I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep . . . tired . . . or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet—and here's no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it toward some overwhelming question,
To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all"—
If one, settling a pillow by her head,
     Should say: "That is not what I meant at all.
     That is not it, at all."

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—
And this, and so much more?—
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
     "That is not it at all,
     That is not what I meant, at all."

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous—
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old . . . I grow old . . .
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.

We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

[1] Dante, Inferno 27.61-66 "If I thought my answer were given / to anyone who would ever return to the world, / this flame would stand still without moving any further. / But since never from this abyss / has anyone ever returned alive, if what I hear is true, /without fear of infamy I answer you."



Directive
by Robert Frost

Back out of all this now too much for us,
Back in a time made simple by the loss
Of detail, burned, dissolved, and broken off
Like graveyard marble sculpture in the weather,
There is a house that is no more a house
Upon a farm that is no more a farm
And in a town that is no more a town.
The road there, if you'll let a guide direct you
Who only has at heart your getting lost,
May seem as if it should have been a quarry—
Great monolithic knees the former town
Long since gave up pretense of keeping covered.
And there's a story in a book about it:
Besides the wear of iron wagon wheels
The ledges show lines ruled southeast-northwest,
The chisel work of an enormous Glacier
That braced his feet against the Arctic Pole.
You must not mind a certain coolness from him
Still said to haunt this side of Panther Mountain.
Nor need you mind the serial ordeal
Of being watched from forty cellar holes
As if by eye pairs out of forty firkins.
As for the woods' excitement over you
That sends light rustle rushes to their leaves,
Charge that to upstart inexperience.
Where were they all not twenty years ago?
They think too much of having shaded out
A few old pecker-fretted apple trees.
Make yourself up a cheering song of how
Someone's road home from work this once was,
Who may be just ahead of you on foot
Or creaking with a buggy load of grain.
The height of the adventure is the height
Of country where two village cultures faded
Into each other. Both of them are lost.
And if you're lost enough to find yourself
By now, pull in your ladder road behind you
And put a sign up CLOSED to all but me.
Then make yourself at home. The only field
Now left's no bigger than a harness gall.
First there's the children's house of make-believe,
Some shattered dishes underneath a pine,
The playthings in the playhouse of the children.
Weep for what little things could make them glad.
Then for the house that is no more a house,
But only a belilaced cellar hole,
Now slowly closing like a dent in dough.
This was no playhouse but a house in earnest.
Your destination and your destiny's
A brook that was the water of the house,
Cold as a spring as yet so near its source,
Too lofty and original to rage.
(We know the valley streams that when aroused
Will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.)
I have kept hidden in the instep arch
Of an old cedar at the waterside
A broken drinking goblet like the Grail
Under a spell so the wrong ones can't find it,
So can't get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn't.
(I stole the goblet from the children's playhouse.)
Here are your waters and your watering place.
Drink and be whole again beyond confusion.



Hurt Hawks
by Robinson Jeffers

The broken pillar of the wing jags from the clotted shoulder,
The wing trails like a banner in defeat,
No more to use the sky forever but live with famine
And pain a few days: cat nor coyote
Will shorten the week of waiting for death, there is game without talons.
He stands under the oak-bush and waits
The lame feet of salvation; at night he remembers freedom
And flies in a dream, the dawns ruin it.
He is strong and pain is worse to the strong, incapacity is worse.
The curs of the day come and torment him
At distance, no one but death the redeemer will humble that head,
The intrepid readiness, the terrible eyes.
The wild God of the world is sometimes merciful to those
That ask mercy, not often to the arrogant.
You do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him;
Intemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him;
Beautiful and wild, the hawks, and men that are dying, remember him.

I'd sooner, except the penalties, kill a man than a hawk; but the great redtail
Had nothing left but unable misery
From the bones too shattered for mending, the wing that trailed under his talons when he moved.
We had fed him for six weeks, I gave him freedom,
He wandered over the foreland hill and returned in the evening, asking for death,
Not like a beggar, still eyed with the old
Implacable arrogance. I gave him the lead gift in the twilight. What fell was relaxed,
Owl-downy, soft feminine feathers; but what
Soared: the fierce rush: the night-herons by the flooded river cried fear at its rising
Before it was quite unsheathed from reality.



The Broken Tower
by Hart Crane

The bell-rope that gathers God at dawn
Dispatches me as though I dropped down the knell
Of a spent day—to wander the cathedral lawn
From pit to crucifix, feet chill on steps from hell.

Have you not heard, have you not seen that corps
Of shadows in the tower, whose shoulders sway
Antiphonal carillons launched before
The stars are caught and hived in the sun's ray?

The bells, I say, the bells break down their tower;
And swing I know not where. Their tongues engrave
Membrane through marrow, my long-scattered score
Of broken intervals ... And I, their sexton slave!

Oval encyclicals in canyons heaping
The impasse high with choir. Banked voices slain!
Pagodas campaniles with reveilles out leaping—
O terraced echoes prostrate on the plain! ...

And so it was I entered the broken world
To trace the visionary company of love, its voice
An instant in the wind (I know not whither hurled)
But not for long to hold each desperate choice.

My word I poured. But was it cognate, scored
Of that tribunal monarch of the air
Whose thighs embronzes earth, strikes crystal Word
In wounds pledged once to hope—cleft to despair?

The steep encroachments of my blood left me
No answer (could blood hold such a lofty tower
As flings the question true?)—or is it she
Whose sweet mortality stirs latent power?—

And through whose pulse I hear, counting the strokes
My veins recall and add, revived and sure
The angelus of wars my chest evokes:
What I hold healed, original now, and pure ...

And builds, within, a tower that is not stone
(Not stone can jacket heaven)—but slip
Of pebbles,—visible wings of silence sown
In azure circles, widening as they dip

The matrix of the heart, lift down the eyes
That shrines the quiet lake and swells a tower ...
The commodious, tall decorum of that sky
Unseals her earth, and lifts love in its shower.



The Fish
by Elizabeth Bishop

I caught a tremendous fish
and held him beside the boat
half out of water, with my hook
fast in a corner of his mouth.
He didn't fight.
He hadn't fought at all.
He hung a grunting weight,
battered and venerable
and homely. Here and there
his brown skin hung in strips
like ancient wallpaper,
and its pattern of darker brown
was like wallpaper:
shapes like full-blown roses
stained and lost through age.
He was speckled with barnacles,
fine rosettes of lime,
and infested
with tiny white sea-lice,
and underneath two or three
rags of green weed hung down.
While his gills were breathing in
the terrible oxygen
—the frightening gills,
fresh and crisp with blood,
that can cut so badly—
I thought of the coarse white flesh
packed in like feathers,
the big bones and the little bones,
the dramatic reds and blacks
of his shiny entrails,
and the pink swim-bladder
like a big peony.
I looked into his eyes
which were far larger than mine
but shallower, and yellowed,
the irises backed and packed
with tarnished tinfoil
seen through the lenses
of old scratched isinglass.
They shifted a little, but not
to return my stare.
—It was more like the tipping
of an object toward the light.
I admired his sullen face,
the mechanism of his jaw,
and then I saw
that from his lower lip
—if you could call it a lip 
grim, wet, and weaponlike,
hung five old pieces of fish-line,
or four and a wire leader
with the swivel still attached,
with all their five big hooks
grown firmly in his mouth.
A green line, frayed at the end
where he broke it, two heavier lines, 
and a fine black thread
still crimped from the strain and snap
when it broke and he got away.
Like medals with their ribbons
frayed and wavering,
a five-haired beard of wisdom
trailing from his aching jaw.
I stared and stared
and victory filled up
the little rented boat,
from the pool of bilge
where oil had spread a rainbow
around the rusted engine
to the bailer rusted orange,
the sun-cracked thwarts,
the oarlocks on their strings,
the gunnels—until everything
was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!
And I let the fish go.



Bagpipe Music
by Louis MacNeice

It's no go the merrygoround, it's no go the rickshaw,
All we want is a limousine and a ticket for the peepshow.
Their knickers are made of crepe-de-chine, their shoes are made of python,
Their halls are lined with tiger rugs and their walls with head of bison.

John MacDonald found a corpse, put it under the sofa,
Waited till it came to life and hit it with a poker,
Sold its eyes for souvenirs, sold its blood for whiskey,
Kept its bones for dumbbells to use when he was fifty.

It's no go the Yogi-man, it's no go Blavatsky,
All we want is a bank balance and a bit of skirt in a taxi.

Annie MacDougall went to milk, caught her foot in the heather,
Woke to hear a dance record playing of Old Vienna.
It's no go your maidenheads, it's no go your culture,
All we want is a Dunlop tire and the devil mend the puncture.

The Laird o' Phelps spent Hogmanay declaring he was sober,
Counted his feet to prove the fact and found he had one foot over.
Mrs. Carmichael had her fifth, looked at the job with repulsion,
Said to the midwife "Take it away; I'm through with overproduction."

It's no go the gossip column, it's no go the Ceilidh,
All we want is a mother's help and a sugar-stick for the baby.

Willie Murray cut his thumb, couldn't count the damage,
Took the hide of an Ayrshire cow and used it for a bandage.
His brother caught three hundred cran when the seas were lavish,
Threw the bleeders back in the sea and went upon the parish.

It's no go the Herring Board, it's no go the Bible,
All we want is a packet of fags when our hands are idle.

It's no go the picture palace, it's no go the stadium,
It's no go the country cot with a pot of pink geraniums,
It's no go the Government grants, it's no go the elections,
Sit on your arse for fifty years and hang your hat on a pension.

It's no go my honey love, it's no go my poppet;
Work your hands from day to day, the winds will blow the profit.
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall forever,
But if you break the bloody glass you won't hold up the weather.



Ode to Autumn
by John Keats

Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;
To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease;
For Summer has o'erbrimm'd their clammy cells.
 
Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap'd furrow sound asleep,
Drowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
Spares the next swath and all its twinèd flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
Steady thy laden head across a brook;
Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
Thou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.
 
Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barrèd clouds bloom the soft-dying day
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river-sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft;
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.



Luke Havergal
by Edward Arlington Robinson

Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal,
There where the vines cling crimson on the wall,
And in the twilight wait for what will come.
The leaves will whisper there of her, and some,
Like flying words, will strike you as they fall;
But go, and if you listen, she will call.
Go to the western gate, Luke Havergal—
Luke Havergal.

No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies
To rift the fiery night that's in your eyes;
But there, where western glooms are gathering
The dark will end the dark, if anything:
God slays Himself with every leaf that flies,
And hell is more than half of paradise.
No, there is not a dawn in eastern skies—
In eastern skies.

Out of a grave I come to tell you this,
Out of a grave I come to quench the kiss
That flames upon your forehead with a glow
That blinds you to the way that you must go.
Yes, there is yet one way to where she is,
Bitter, but one that faith may never miss.
Out of a grave I come to tell you this—
To tell you this.

There is the western gate, Luke Havergal,
There are the crimson leaves upon the wall,
Go, for the winds are tearing them away,—
Nor think to riddle the dead words they say,
Nor any more to feel them as they fall;
But go, and if you trust her she will call.
There is the western gate, Luke Havergal—
Luke Havergal.



Naming of Parts 
by Henry Reed

"Vixi duellis nuper idoneus
Et militavi non sine glori"

Today we have naming of parts. Yesterday,
We had daily cleaning. And tomorrow morning,
We shall have what to do after firing. But today,
Today we have naming of parts. Japonica
Glistens like coral in all of the neighboring gardens,
   And today we have naming of parts.

This is the lower sling swivel. And this
Is the upper sling swivel, whose use you will see
When you are given your slings. And this is the piling swivel,
Which in your case you have not got. The branches
Hold in the gardens their silent, eloquent gestures,
   Which in our case we have not got.

This is the safety-catch, which is always released
With an easy flick of the thumb. And please do not let me
See anyone using his finger. You can do it quite easily
If you have any strength in your thumb. The blossoms
Are fragile and motionless, never letting anyone see
   Any of them using their finger.

And this you can see is the bolt. The purpose of this
Is to open the breech, as you see. We can slide it
Rapidly backwards and forwards: we call this
Easing the spring. And rapidly backwards and forwards
The early bees are assaulting and fumbling the flowers:
   They call it easing the Spring.

They call it easing the Spring: it is perfectly easy
If you have any strength in your thumb: like the bolt,
And the breech, and the cocking-piece, and the point of balance,
Which in our case we have not got; and the almond-blossom
Silent in all of the gardens and the bees going backwards and forwards,
   For today we have naming of parts.



The Armadillo 
by Elizabeth Bishop

for Robert Lowell

This is the time of year
when almost every night
the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.
Climbing the mountain height,

rising toward a saint
still honored in these parts,
the paper chambers flush and fill with light
that comes and goes, like hearts.

Once up against the sky it's hard
to tell them from the stars—
planets, that is—the tinted ones:
Venus going down, or Mars,

or the pale green one. With a wind,
they flare and falter, wobble and toss;
but if it's still they steer between
the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,

receding, dwindling, solemnly
and steadily forsaking us,
or, in the downdraft from a peak,
suddenly turning dangerous.

Last night another big one fell.
It splattered like an egg of fire
against the cliff behind the house.
The flame ran down. We saw the pair

of owls who nest there flying up
and up, their whirling black-and-white
stained bright pink underneath, until
they shrieked up out of sight.

The ancient owls' nest must have burned.
Hastily, all alone,
a glistening armadillo left the scene,
rose-flecked, head down, tail down,

and then a baby rabbit jumped out,
short-eared, to our surprise.
So soft!—a handful of intangible ash
with fixed, ignited eyes.

Too pretty, dreamlike mimicry!
O falling fire and piercing cry
and panic, and a weak mailed fist
clenched ignorant against the sky!



The Convergence Of The Twain 
by Thomas Hardy

Lines on the loss of the "Titanic"

           In a solitude of the sea
           Deep from human vanity,
And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.
           Steel chambers, late the pyres
           Of her salamandrine fires,
Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.
           Over the mirrors meant
           To glass the opulent
The sea-worm crawls—grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.
           Jewels in joy designed
           To ravish the sensuous mind
Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.
           Dim moon-eyed fishes near
           Gaze at the gilded gear
And query: "What does this vaingloriousness down here?"...
           Well: while was fashioning
           This creature of cleaving wing,
The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything
           Prepared a sinister mate
           For her—so gaily great—
A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.
           And as the smart ship grew
           In stature, grace, and hue,
In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.
           Alien they seemed to be;
           No mortal eye could see
The intimate welding of their later history,
           Or sign that they were bent
           By paths coincident
On being anon twin halves of one august event,
           Till the Spinner of the Years
           Said "Now!" And each one hears,
And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.



Dover Beach
by Matthew Arnold

The sea is calm to-night,
The tide is full, the moon lies fair
Upon the straits; on the French coast the light
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!
Only, from the long line of spray
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched land,
Listen! you hear the grating roar
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,
At their return, up the high strand,
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring
The eternal note of sadness in.

Sophocles long ago
Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought
Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow
Of human misery; we
Find also in the sound a thought,
Hearing it by this distant northern sea.

The sea of faith
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.
But now I only hear
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,
Retreating, to the breath
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear
And naked shingles of the world.

Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;
And we are here as on a darkling plain
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,
Where ignorant armies clash by night.



Dulce Et Decorum Est
by Wilfred Owen

Bent double, like old beggars under sacks 
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags, we cursed through sludge, 
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs 
And towards our distant rest began to trudge. 
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots 
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; 
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots 
Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind. 

Gas! GAS! Quick, boys!—An ecstasy of fumbling, 
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time; 
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling 
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime... 
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, 
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. 

In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, 
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. 

If in some smothering dreams you too could pace 
Behind the wagon that we flung him in, 
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face, 
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; 
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood 
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, 
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud 
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues,—
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest 
To children ardent for some desperate glory, 
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est 
Pro patria mori.

Note: "Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori" is from Horace's Odes and means: "It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country."



Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae 
by Ernest Dowson

"I am not as I was under the reign of the good Cynara"—Horace

Last night, ah, yesternight, betwixt her lips and mine 
There fell thy shadow, Cynara! thy breath was shed
Upon my soul between the kisses and the wine;
And I was desolate and sick of an old passion,
Yea, I was desolate and bowed my head:
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.

All night upon mine heart I felt her warm heart beat,
Night-long within mine arms in love and sleep she lay;
Surely the kisses of her bought red mouth were sweet;
But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,
When I awoke and found the dawn was gray:
I have been faithful to you, Cynara! in my fashion. 

I have forgot much, Cynara! gone with the wind,
Flung roses, roses riotously with the throng,
Dancing, to put thy pale, lost lilies out of mind;
But I was desolate and sick of an old passion,
Yea, all the time, because the dance was long;
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion. 

I cried for madder music and for stronger wine,
But when the feast is finished and the lamps expire,
Then falls thy shadow, Cynara! the night is thine;
And I am desolate and sick of an old passion,
Yea, hungry for the lips of my desire:
I have been faithful to thee, Cynara! in my fashion.



Song of Solomon 
attributed to King Solomon

I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons.
I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.
Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.
His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes,
and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor wake my love, till he please.

The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall,
he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.
My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;
The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come,
and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell.
Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.

O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance,
let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.
Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.

My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.
Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved,
and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.



Is My Team Plowing
by A. E. Housman

"Is my team ploughing,
That I was used to drive
And hear the harness jingle
When I was man alive?"

Ay, the horses trample,
The harness jingles now;
No change though you lie under
The land you used to plough.

"Is football playing
Along the river shore,
With lads to chase the leather,
Now I stand up no more?"

Ay, the ball is flying,
The lads play heart and soul;
The goal stands up, the keeper
Stands up to keep the goal.

"Is my girl happy,
That I thought hard to leave,
And has she tired of weeping
As she lies down at eve?"

Ay, she lies down lightly,
She lies not down to weep,
Your girl is well contented.
Be still, my lad, and sleep.

"Is my friend hearty,
Now I am thin and pine,
And has he found to sleep in
A better bed than mine?"

Yes, lad, I lie easy,
I lie as lads would choose;
I cheer a dead man's sweetheart,
Never ask me whose.



The Waif 
by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

The day is done, and the darkness
Falls from the wings of Night,
As a feather is wafted downward
From an eagle in his flight.

I see the lights of the village
Gleam through the rain and the mist,
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me
That my soul cannot resist:

A feeling of sadness and longing,
That is not akin to pain,
And resembles sorrow only
As the mist resembles the rain.

Come, read to me some poem,
Some simple and heartfelt lay,
That shall soothe this restless feeling,
And banish the thoughts of day.

Not from the grand old masters,
Not from the bards sublime,
Whose distant footsteps echo
Through the corridors of Time,

For, like strains of martial music,
Their mighty thoughts suggest
Life's endless toil and endeavor;
And tonight I long for rest.

Read from some humbler poet,
Whose songs gushed from his heart,
As showers from the clouds of summer,
Or tears from the eyelids start;

Who, through long days of labor,
And nights devoid of ease,
Still heard in his soul the music
Of wonderful melodies.

Such songs have a power to quiet
The restless pulse of care,
And comes like the benediction
That follows after prayer.

Then read from the treasured volume
The poem of thy choice,
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
The beauty of thy voice.

And the night shall be filled with music,
And the cares, that infest the day,
Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,
And as silently steal away.



O Black and Unknown Bards
by James Weldon Johnson

O black and unknown bards of long ago,
How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
How, in your darkness, did you come to know
The power and beauty of the minstrel's lyre?
Who first from midst his bonds lifted his eyes?
Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,
Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise
Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?
Heart of what slave poured out such melody
As "Steal away to Jesus"? On its strains
His spirit must have nightly floated free,
Though still about his hands he felt his chains.
Who heard great "Jordan roll"? Whose starward eye
Saw chariot "swing low"? And who was he
That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,
"Nobody knows de trouble I see"?

What merely living clod, what captive thing,
Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,
And find within its deadened heart to sing
These songs of sorrow, love, and faith, and hope?
How did it catch that subtle undertone,
That note in music heard not with the ears?
How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,
Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.

Not that great German master in his dream
Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars
At the creation, ever heard a theme
Nobler than "Go down, Moses." Mark its bars,
How like a mighty trumpet-call they stir
The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung
Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were
That helped make history when Time was young.

There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,
That from degraded rest and servile toil
The fiery spirit of the seer should call
These simple children of the sun and soil.
O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,
You—you alone, of all the long, long line
Of those who've sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,
Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.

You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;
No chant of bloody war, no exulting pean
Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings
You touched in chord with music empyrean.
You sang far better than you knew; the songs
That for your listeners' hungry hearts sufficed
Still live,—but more than this to you belongs:
You sang a race from wood and stone to Christ.



The Dead Man Walking 
by Thomas Hardy

They hail me as one living, 
But don't they know 
That I have died of late years, 
Untombed although? 

I am but a shape that stands here, 
A pulseless mould, 
A pale past picture, screening 
Ashes gone cold. 

Not at a minute's warning, 
Not in a loud hour, 
For me ceased Time's enchantments 
In hall and bower. 

There was no tragic transit, 
No catch of breath, 
When silent seasons inched me 
On to this death .... 

—A Troubadour-youth I rambled
With Life for lyre, 
The beats of being raging 
In me like fire. 

But when I practised eyeing 
The goal of men, 
It iced me, and I perished 
A little then. 

When passed my friend, my kinsfolk, 
Through the Last Door, 
And left me standing bleakly, 
I died yet more; 

And when my Love's heart kindled 
In hate of me, 
Wherefore I knew not, died I 
One more degree. 

And if when I died fully 
I cannot say, 
And changed into the corpse-thing 
I am to-day, 

Yet is it that, though whiling 
The time somehow 
In walking, talking, smiling, 
I live not now. 



The Pelagian Drinking Song 
by Hillaire Belloc

Pelagius lived at Kardanoel
And taught a doctrine there
How, whether you went to heaven or to hell
It was your own affair.
It had nothing to do with the Church, my boy,
But was your own affair.

No, he didn't believe
In Adam and Eve
He put no faith therein!
His doubts began
With the Fall of Man
And he laughed at Original Sin.
With my row-ti-tow
Ti-oodly-ow
He laughed at original sin.

Then came the bishop of old Auxerre
Germanus was his name
He tore great handfuls out of his hair
And he called Pelagius shame.
And with his stout Episcopal staff
So thoroughly whacked and banged
The heretics all, both short and tall—
They rather had been hanged.

Oh he whacked them hard, and he banged them long
Upon each and all occasions
Till they bellowed in chorus, loud and strong
Their orthodox persuasions.
With my row-ti-tow
Ti-oodly-ow
Their orthodox persuasions.

Now the faith is old and the Devil bold
Exceedingly bold indeed.
And the masses of doubt that are floating about
Would smother a mortal creed.
But we that sit in a sturdy youth
And still can drink strong ale
Let us put it away to infallible truth
That always shall prevail.

And thank the Lord
For the temporal sword
And howling heretics too.
And all good things
Our Christendom brings
But especially barley brew!
With my row-ti-tow
Ti-oodly-ow
Especially barley brew!



For Una
by Robinson Jeffers

I

I built her a tower when I was young—
Sometime she will die—
I built it with my hands, I hung
Stones in the sky.

Old but still strong I climb the stone—
Sometime she will die—
Climb the steep rough steps alone,
And weep in the sky.

Never weep, never weep.

II

Never be astonished, dear.
Expect change,
Nothing is strange.

We have seen the human race
Capture all its dreams,
All except peace.

We have watched mankind like Christ
Toil up and up,
To be hanged at the top.

No longer envying the birds,
That ancient prayer for
Wings granted: therefore

The heavy sky over London
Stallion-hoofed
Falls on the roofs.

These are the falling years,
They will go deep,
Never weep, never weep.

With clear eyes explore the pit.
Watch the great fall
With religious awe.

III

It is not Europe alone that is falling
Into blood and fire.
Decline and fall have been dancing in all men's souls
For a long while.

Sometime at the last gasp comes peace
To every soul.
Never to mine until I find out and speak
The things that I know.

IV

To-morrow I will take up that heavy poem again
About Ferguson, deceived and jealous man
Who bawled for the truth, the truth, and failed to endure
Its first least gleam. That poem bores me, and I hope will bore
Any sweet soul that reads it, being some ways
My very self but mostly my antipodes;
But having waved the heavy artillery to fire
I must hammer on to an end.

To-night, dear,
Let's forget all that, that and the war,
And enisle ourselves a little beyond time,
You with this Irish whiskey, I with red wine
While the stars go over the sleepless ocean,
And sometime after midnight I'll pluck you a wreath
Of chosen ones; we'll talk about love and death,
Rock-solid themes, old and deep as the sea,
Admit nothing more timely, nothing less real
While the stars go over the timeless ocean,
And when they vanish we'll have spent the night well.



The Lie
by Sir Walter Ralegh

Go, soul, the body's guest,
Upon a thankless errand;
Fear not to touch the best;
The truth shall be thy warrant:
Go, since I needs must die,
And give the world the lie.

Say to the court it glows
And shines like rotten wood,
Say to the church it shows
What's good, and doth no good:
If church and court reply,
Then give them both the lie.

Tell potentates, they live
Acting, by others' action;
Not lov'd unless they give;
Not strong, but by affection.
If potentates reply,
Give potentates the lie.

Tell men of high condition,
That manage the estate,
Their purpose is ambition;
Their practice only hate.
And if they once reply,
Then give them all the lie.

Tell them that brave it most,
They beg for more by spending,
Who in their greatest cost
Like nothing but commending.
And if they make reply,
Then give them all the lie.

Tell zeal it wants devotion;
Tell love it is but lust;
Tell time it meets but motion;
Tell flesh it is but dust:
And wish them not reply,
For thou must give the lie.

Tell age it daily wasteth;
Tell honour how it alters;
Tell beauty how she blasteth;
Tell favour how it falters:
And as they shall reply,
Give every one the lie.

Tell wit how much it wrangles
In fickle points of niceness;
Tell wisdom she entangles
Herself in over-wiseness:
And when they do reply,
Straight give them both the lie.

Tell physic of her boldness;
Tell skill it is prevention;
Tell charity of coldness;
Tell law it is contention:
And as they do reply,
So give them still the lie.

Tell fortune of her blindness;
Tell nature of decay;
Tell friendship of unkindness;
Tell justice of delay:
And if they will reply,
Then give them all the lie.

Tell arts they have no soundness,
But vary by esteeming;
Tell schools they want profoundness,
And stand too much on seeming.
If arts and schools reply,
Give arts and schools the lie.

Tell faith it's fled the city;
Tell how the country erreth;
Tell manhood, shakes off pity;
Tell virtue, least preferred.
And if they do reply,
Spare not to give the lie.

So when thou hast, as I
Commanded thee, done blabbing;
Because to give the lie
Deserves no less than stabbing:
Stab at thee, he that will,
No stab thy soul can kill!



Skunk Hour
by Robert Lowell

for Elizabeth Bishop

Nautilus Island's hermit
heiress still lives through winter in her Spartan cottage;
her sheep still graze above the sea.
Her son's a bishop. Her farmer
is first selectman in our village;
she's in her dotage.

Thirsting for
the hierarchic privacy
of Queen Victoria's century,
she buys up all
the eyesores facing her shore,
and lets them fall.

The season's ill—
we've lost our summer millionaire,
who seemed to leap from an L. L. Bean
catalogue. His nine-knot yawl
was auctioned off to lobstermen.
A red fox stain covers Blue Hill.

And now our fairy
decorator brightens his shop for fall;
his fishnet's filled with orange cork,
orange, his cobbler's bench and awl;
there is no money in his work,
he'd rather marry.

One dark night,
my Tudor Ford climbed the hill's skull;
I watched for love-cars. Lights turned down,
they lay together, hull to hull,
where the graveyard shelves on the town. . . .
My mind's not right.

A car radio bleats,
"Love, O careless Love. . . ." I hear
my ill-spirit sob in each blood cell,
as if my hand were at its throat. . . .
I myself am hell;
nobody's here—

only skunks, that search
in the moonlight for a bite to eat.
They march on their soles up Main Street:
white stripes, moonstruck eyes' red fire
under the chalk-dry and spar spire
of the Trinitarian Church.

I stand on top
of our back steps and breathe the rich air—
a mother skunk with her column of kittens swills the garbage pail.
She jabs her wedge-head in a cup
of sour cream, drops her ostrich tail,
and will not scare.



Mariana 
by Lord Alfred Tennyson

‘Mariana in the moated grange.'—Measure for Measure. 

With blackest moss the flower-plots
   Were thickly crusted, one and all:
The rusted nails fell from the knots
   That held the pear to the gable-wall.
The broken sheds look'd sad and strange:
   Unlifted was the clinking latch;
   Weeded and worn the ancient thatch
Upon the lonely moated grange.
     She only said, ‘My life is dreary,
       He cometh not,' she said;
     She said, ‘I am aweary, aweary,
       I would that I were dead!'

Her tears fell with the dews at even;
   Her tears fell ere the dews were dried;
She could not look on the sweet heaven,
   Either at morn or eventide.
After the flitting of the bats,
   When thickest dark did trance the sky,
   She drew her casement-curtain by,
And glanced athwart the glooming flats.
     She only said, ‘The night is dreary,
       He cometh not,' she said;
     She said, ‘I am aweary, aweary,
       I would that I were dead!'

Upon the middle of the night,
   Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:
The cock sung out an hour ere light:
   From the dark fen the oxen's low
Came to her: without hope of change,
   In sleep she seem'd to walk forlorn,
   Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed morn
About the lonely moated grange.
     She only said, ‘The day is dreary,
       He cometh not,' she said;
     She said, ‘I am aweary, aweary,
       I would that I were dead!'

About a stone-cast from the wall
   A sluice with blacken'd waters slept,
And o'er it many, round and small,
   The cluster'd marish-mosses crept.
Hard by a poplar shook alway,
   All silver-green with gnarled bark:
   For leagues no other tree did mark
The level waste, the rounding gray.
     She only said, ‘My life is dreary,
       He cometh not,' she said;
     She said, ‘I am aweary, aweary,
       I would that I were dead!'

And ever when the moon was low,
   And the shrill winds were up and away,
In the white curtain, to and fro,
   She saw the gusty shadow sway.
But when the moon was very low,
   And wild winds bound within their cell,
   The shadow of the poplar fell
Upon her bed, across her brow.
     She only said, ‘The night is dreary,
       He cometh not,' she said;
     She said, ‘I am aweary, aweary,
       I would that I were dead!'

All day within the dreamy house,
   The doors upon their hinges creak'd;
The blue fly sung in the pane; the mouse
   Behind the mouldering wainscot shriek'd,
Or from the crevice peer'd about.
   Old faces glimmer'd thro' the doors,
   Old footsteps trod the upper floors,
Old voices called her from without.
     She only said, ‘My life is dreary,
       He cometh not,' she said;
     She said, ‘I am aweary, aweary,
       I would that I were dead!'

The sparrow's chirrup on the roof,
   The slow clock ticking, and the sound
Which to the wooing wind aloof
   The poplar made, did all confound
Her sense; but most she loathed the hour
   When the thick-moted sunbeam lay
   Athwart the chambers, and the day
Was sloping toward his western bower.
     Then, said she, ‘I am very dreary,
       He will not come,' she said;
     She wept, ‘I am aweary, aweary,
       Oh God, that I were dead!'



Ulysses 
by Lord Alfred Tennyson

It little profits that an idle king,
By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
Matched with an aged wife, I mete and dole
Unequal laws unto a savage race,
That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.
I cannot rest from travel; I will drink
Life to the lees. All times I have enjoyed
Greatly, have suffered greatly, both with those
That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when
Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
Vext the dim sea. I am become a name;
For always roaming with a hungry heart.
Much have I seen and known—cities of men
And manners, climates, councils, governments,
Myself not least, but honored of them all,—
And drunk delight of battle with my peers,
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.
I am a part of all that I have met;
Yet all experience is an arch wherethrough
Gleams that untraveled world whose margin fades
For ever and for ever when I move.
How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!
As though to breathe were life! Life piled on life
Were all too little, and of one to me
Little remains; but every hour is saved
From that eternal silence, something more,
A bringer of new things; and vile it were
For some three suns to store and hoard myself,
And this gray spirit yearning in desire
To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.
     This is my son, mine own Telemachus,
To whom I leave the scepter and the isle,
Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfill
This labor, by slow prudence to make mild
A rugged people, and through soft degrees
Subdue them to the useful and the good.
Most blameless is he, centered in the sphere
Of common duties, decent not to fail
In offices of tenderness, and pay
Meet adoration to my household gods,
When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.
     There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail;
There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,
Souls that have toiled, and wrought, and thought with me,
That ever with a frolic welcome took
The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;
Old age hath yet his honor and his toil.
Death closes all; but something ere the end,
Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
Not unbecoming men that strove with gods.
The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks;
The long day wanes; the slow moon climbs; the deep
Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
Push off, and sitting well in order smite
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
Of all the western stars, until I die.
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down;
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
Though much is taken, much abides; and though
We are not now that strength which in old days
Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.



Tulips
by Sylvia Plath

The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.
Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.
I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly
As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.
I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.
I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses
And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.

They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff
Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.
The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,
They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,
Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,
So it is impossible to tell how many there are.

My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water
Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.
They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.
Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage——
My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,
My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;
Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.

I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat
stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.
They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley
I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books
Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.
I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.

I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.
How free it is, you have no idea how free——
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.

The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.
They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.

Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.

Before they came the air was calm enough,
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
They concentrate my attention, that was happy
Playing and resting without committing itself.

The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,
And comes from a country far away as health.



You, Andrew Marvell
by Archibald MacLeish

And here face down beneath the sun
And here upon earth's noonward height
To feel the always coming on
The always rising of the night:

To feel creep up the curving east
The earthy chill of dusk and slow
Upon those under lands the vast
And ever climbing shadow grow

And strange at Ecbatan the trees
Take leaf by leaf the evening strange
The flooding dark about their knees
The mountains over Persia change

And now at Kermanshah the gate
Dark empty and the withered grass
And through the twilight now the late
Few travelers in the westward pass

And Baghdad darken and the bridge
Across the silent river gone
And through Arabia the edge
Of evening widen and steal on

And deepen on Palmyra's street
The wheel rut in the ruined stone
And Lebanon fade out and Crete
high through the clouds and overblown

And over Sicily the air
Still flashing with the landward gulls
And loom and slowly disappear
The sails above the shadowy hulls

And Spain go under and the shore
Of Africa the gilded sand
And evening vanish and no more
The low pale light across that land

Nor now the long light on the sea:
And here face downward in the sun
To feel how swift how secretly
The shadow of the night comes on...



Memorial Rain
by Archibald MacLeish

for Kenneth MacLeish, 1894-1918

Ambassador Puser the ambassador
Reminds himself in French, felicitous tongue,
What these (young men no longer) lie here for
In rows that once, and somewhere else, were young…

All night in Brussels the wind had tugged at my door:
I had heard the wind at my door and the trees strung
Taut, and to me who had never been before
In that country it was a strange wind, blowing
Steadily, stiffening the walls, the floor,
The roof of my room. I had not slept for knowing
He too, dead, was a stranger in that land
And felt beneath the earth in the wind's flowing
A tightening of roots and would not understand,
Remembering lake winds in Illinois,
That strange wind. I had felt his bones in the sand
Listening.

…Reflects that these enjoy
Their country's gratitude, that deep repose,
That peace no pain can break, no hurt destroy,
That rest, that sleep…

At Ghent the wind rose.
There was a smell of rain and a heavy drag
Of wind in the hedges but not as the wind blows
Over fresh water when the waves lag
Foaming and the willows huddle and it will rain:
I felt him waiting.

…Indicates the flag
Which (may he say) enisles in Flanders plain
This little field these happy, happy dead
Have made America…

In the ripe grain
The wind coiled glistening, darted, fled,
Dragging its heavy body: at Waereghem
The wind coiled in the grass above his head:
Waiting—listening…

…Dedicates to them
This earth their bones have hallowed, this last gift
A Grateful country…

Under the dry grass stem
The words are blurred, are thickened, the words sift
Confused by the rasp of the wind, by the thin grating
Of ants under the grass, the minute shift
And tumble of dusty sand separating
From dusty sand. The roots of the grass strain,
Tighten, the earth is rigid, waits—he is waiting—

And suddenly, and all at once, the rain!

The living scatter, they run into houses, the wind
Is trampled under the rain, shakes free, is again
Trampled. The rain gathers, running in thinned
Spurts of water that ravel in the dry sand,
Seeping in the sand under the grass roots, seeping
Between cracked boards to the bones of a clenched hand:
The earth relaxes, loosens; he is sleeping,
He rests, he is quiet, he sleeps in a strange land.



As I Grew Older
by Langston Hughes

It was a long time ago.
I have almost forgotten my dream.
But it was there then,
In front of me,
Bright like a sun—
My dream.
And then the wall rose,
Rose slowly,
Slowly,
Between me and my dream.
Rose until it touched the sky—
The wall.
Shadow.
I am black.
I lie down in the shadow.
No longer the light of my dream before me,
Above me.
Only the thick wall.
Only the shadow.
My hands!
My dark hands!
Break through the wall!
Find my dream!
Help me to shatter this darkness,
To smash this night,
To break this shadow
Into a thousand lights of sun,
Into a thousand whirling dreams
Of sun!



When We Two Parted
by George Gordon, Lord Byron

When we two parted
In silence and tears,
Half broken-hearted
To sever for years,
Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
Colder thy kiss;
Truly that hour foretold
Sorrow to this.

The dew of the morning
Sunk chill on my brow—
It felt like the warning
Of what I feel now.

Thy vows are all broken,
And light is thy fame;
I hear thy name spoken,
And share in its shame.

They name thee before me,
A knell to mine ear;
A shudder comes o'er me—
Why wert thou so dear?
They know not I knew thee,
Who knew thee too well—
Long, long shall I rue thee,
To deeply to tell.

In secret we met—
In silence I grieve,
That thy heart could forget,
Thy spirit deceive.

If I should meet thee
After long years,
How should I greet thee?—
With silence and tears.



The Listeners 
by Walter De La Mare

'Is there anybody there?' said the Traveller,
Knocking on the moonlit door;
And his horse in the silence champed the grasses
Of the forest's ferny floor:
And a bird flew up out of the turret,
Above the Traveller's head
And he smote upon the door again a second time;
'Is there anybody there?' he said.
But no one descended to the Traveller;
No head from the leaf-fringed sill
Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,
Where he stood perplexed and still.
But only a host of phantom listeners
That dwelt in the lone house then
Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight
To that voice from the world of men:
Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,
That goes down to the empty hall,
Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken
By the lonely Traveller's call.
And he felt in his heart their strangeness,
Their stillness answering his cry,
While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,
'Neath the starred and leafy sky;
For he suddenly smote on the door, even
Louder, and lifted his head:—
'Tell them I came, and no one answered,
That I kept my word,' he said.
Never the least stir made the listeners,
Though every word he spake
Fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house
From the one man left awake:
Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,
And the sound of iron on stone,
And how the silence surged softly backward,
When the plunging hoofs were gone.



Valentine
by Elinor Wylie

Too high, too high to pluck 
My heart shall swing. 
A fruit no bee shall suck, 
No wasp shall sting.

If on some night of cold 
It falls to ground 
In apple-leaves of gold 
I'll wrap it round.

And I shall seal it up 
With spice and salt, 
In a carven silver cup, 
In a deep vault. 

Before my eyes are blind 
And my lips mute, 
I must eat core and rind 
Of that same fruit. 

Before my heart is dust 
At the end of all, 
Eat it I must, I must 
Were it bitter gall. 
But I shall keep it sweet 
By some strange art; 
Wild honey I shall eat 
When I eat my heart. 

O honey cool and chaste 
As clover's breath! 
Sweet Heaven I shall taste 
Before my death.



Wanting to Die
by Anne Sexton

Since you ask, most days I cannot remember.
I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage.
Then the almost unnameable lust returns.

Even then I have nothing against life.
I know well the grass blades you mention,
the furniture you have placed under the sun.

But suicides have a special language.
Like carpenters they want to know which tools.
They never ask why build.

Twice I have so simply declared myself,
have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy,
have taken on his craft, his magic.

In this way, heavy and thoughtful,
warmer than oil or water,
I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole.

I did not think of my body at needle point.
Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone.
Suicides have already betrayed the body.

Still-born, they don't always die,
but dazzled, they can't forget a drug so sweet
that even children would look on and smile.

To thrust all that life under your tongue!—
that, all by itself, becomes a passion.
Death's a sad bone; bruised, you'd say,

and yet she waits for me, year after year,
to so delicately undo an old wound,
to empty my breath from its bad prison.

Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet,
raging at the fruit a pumped-up moon,
leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss,

leaving the page of the book carelessly open,
something unsaid, the phone off the hook
and the love whatever it was, an infection.



The Writer
by Richard Wilbur

In her room at the prow of the house
Where light breaks, and the windows are tossed with linden,
My daughter is writing a story.

I pause in the stairwell, hearing
From her shut door a commotion of typewriter-keys
Like a chain hauled over a gunwale.

Young as she is, the stuff
Of her life is a great cargo, and some of it heavy:
I wish her a lucky passage.

But now it is she who pauses,
As if to reject my thought and its easy figure.
A stillness greatens, in which

The whole house seems to be thinking,
And then she is at it again with a bunched clamor
Of strokes, and again is silent.

I remember the dazed starling
Which was trapped in that very room, two years ago;
How we stole in, lifted a sash

And retreated, not to affright it;
And how for a helpless hour, through the crack of the door,
We watched the sleek, wild, dark

And iridescent creature
Batter against the brilliance, drop like a glove
To the hard floor, or the desk-top,

And wait then, humped and bloody,
For the wits to try it again; and how our spirits
Rose when, suddenly sure,

It lifted off from a chair-back,
Beating a smooth course for the right window
And clearing the sill of the world.

It is always a matter, my darling,
Of life or death, as I had forgotten. I wish
What I wished you before, but harder.
